This code is a triple threat, quite literally! It runs not one, not two, but THREE elevators. That's right, three times the fun, three times the excitement, and three times the potential for awkward elevator small talk.

But fear not, this code is no joke. It's been rigorously tested to ensure smooth operation and minimal wait times. You'll never have to worry about being stuck in a cramped elevator with that one person who insists on sharing their life story (we all know that person).

So come on, hop on board and let this code take you to new heights (literally). And who knows, maybe you'll even make a new elevator buddy or two. Just remember to keep the conversations light and fluffy, like the clouds you'll be soaring above. Happy elevator riding!
